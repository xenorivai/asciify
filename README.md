# asciify

- Converts `jpeg\png` images to `ascii` and prints to terminal.
#### Build :
---
- 	Two options to build:
	- Cmake
	``` 
	mkdir -p build/
	cd build
	cmake -S .. -B .			
	```
	- Make
		- If you don't want to use cmake for some reason, this would put built files in the `/asciify` directory simply run `make` from where binary is located
- Usage : `./main [path-to-image] `
	- example : `./main ../img/awesomeface.png`
